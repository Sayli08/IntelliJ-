# Introduction to IntelliJ IDEA: Your Java Programming Companion

- For this course, we're going to use an IDE called IntelliJ IDEA. 
- An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a tool used to write programs. 
- The main feature is a text editor where we type our code, but an IDE also compiles and runs our programs for us. 
- Additionally, it warns us about errors in our code before we run it, making the development process smoother.

The IDE we're going to use is IntelliJ IDEA, created by JetBrains. While there are other IDEs available, and you can use any that you prefer, IntelliJ IDEA is highly recommended, especially if you haven't used an IDE before. Using IntelliJ IDEA will ensure your environment works seamlessly.

## Downloading and Installing IntelliJ IDEA

To get started, we need to download and install IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Visit [jetbrains.com](https://jetbrains.com) in your browser.
2. Hover over "Developer Tools" at the top, and click "IntelliJ IDEA."
3. Click "Download."
4. Select your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux) and choose the "Community Edition" of IntelliJ IDEA for download. The "Ultimate Edition" is a paid version and is not needed for this course.
5. Start the download and wait for it to complete.

## Installation Steps

Once the download is complete, follow these steps:

1. Open the downloaded file to start the installation.
2. A wizard popup will appear. Click "Yes" to allow the installation to proceed.
3. Click "Next," and then "Next" again.
4. Optionally, choose to create a Desktop shortcut, and click "Next."
5. Click "Install" without changing any other settings, and wait for the installation to finish.

## Configuration

After the installation is complete, proceed with the configuration:

1. **Start IntelliJ IDEA**: Launch the application if it hasn’t started automatically.
2. **User Agreement**: Agree to the user agreement by clicking the checkbox and then clicking "Continue."
3. **Data Sharing**: Select "Don't send" for data sharing.
4. **New Project Setup**: You'll see options for creating a new project, opening an existing project, or getting a project from a Version Control System (VCS). Click "New Project" to create a new one.
5. **JDK Configuration**: IntelliJ IDEA will attempt to detect the installed JDK. If it doesn’t find it, manually add it by navigating to the installation folder (e.g., Program Files -> Java -> JDK version on Windows).

### Customizing IntelliJ IDEA

Before starting a new project, customize IntelliJ settings:

1. **Theme**: Go to "Customize" -> "All settings" and choose a theme. "Darcula" is recommended for its gentle-on-the-eyes background, but you can choose any theme you prefer.
2. **Editor Settings**:
    - **Auto-import**: Enable "Add unambiguous imports on the fly" and "Optimize imports on the fly."
    - **Code Folding**: Uncheck "File header," "Imports," "One line methods," "Closures," and "Generic constructor and method parameters" to see all the code.
3. **Appearance**: Ensure "Show line numbers" is checked for better code navigation.

With IntelliJ IDEA configured, you're ready to start Java programming.
