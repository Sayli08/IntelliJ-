# Introduction to IntelliJ IDEA: Your Java Programming Companion

For this course, we're going to use an IDE called IntelliJ IDEA. An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a tool used to write programs. The main feature is a text editor where we type our code, but an IDE also compiles and runs our programs for us. Additionally, it warns us about errors in our code before we run it, making the development process smoother.

The IDE we're going to use is IntelliJ IDEA, created by JetBrains. While there are other IDEs available, and you can use any that you prefer, IntelliJ IDEA is highly recommended, especially if you haven't used an IDE before. Using IntelliJ IDEA will ensure your environment works the same way as demonstrated in the videos.

## Downloading and Installing IntelliJ IDEA

To get started, we need to download and install IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Visit [jetbrains.com](https://jetbrains.com) in your browser.
2. Hover over "Developer Tools" at the top, and click "IntelliJ IDEA."
3. Click "Download."
4. Ensure "Windows" is selected and choose the "Community Edition" of IntelliJ IDEA for download. The "Ultimate Edition" is a paid version and is not needed for this course.
5. Start the download and wait for it to complete.

## Installation Steps

Once the download is complete:

1. Open the downloaded file to start the installation.
2. A wizard popup will appear. Click "Yes" to allow the installation to proceed.
3. Click "Next," and then "Next" again.
4. Optionally, choose to create a Desktop shortcut, and click "Next."
5. Click "Install" without changing any other settings, and wait for the installation to finish.

## Configuration

After the installation is complete, proceed to the IntelliJ configuration video in this section. There are important configurations needed to get everything working correctly. Follow along in the video to ensure your setup matches the course requirements.

I'll see you in the configuration video to continue setting up IntelliJ IDEA for our Java programming journey.
