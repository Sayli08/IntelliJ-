# Comparing Code and Utilizing IntelliJ's Features

## Introduction
- In this video, we'll explore how to effectively compare your code with provided solutions using IntelliJ's features. 
- These tools can help identify differences, revert to previous versions, and ensure your code aligns with the solutions, all without the need to manually cross-reference video content.

## Comparing Your Code with the Solution
First, remember that my solution is available as a zip file in the resources section of each lecture. This file contains the entire IntelliJ project for you to download and unzip.

To compare your code with the provided solution:

1. **Download and Unzip the Solution**: Extract the zip file containing my solution.
2. **Open the Project Panel**: Click the "Project" tab on the left of the IntelliJ editor window.
3. **Right-Click on Your Class**: In the project panel, navigate to your class (e.g., `MethodChallenge`), right-click on it, and select "Compare with".
4. **Navigate to the Downloaded File**: Locate the unzipped solution and select the corresponding class file (`MethodChallenge.java`).

IntelliJ will display both files side-by-side, highlighting the differences. The left side shows your current project code, while the right side displays the downloaded solution. Use the arrows in the center to accept changes from one side to the other, ensuring your code matches the solution.

## Using Local History
IntelliJ also keeps a local history of your code changes, which can be invaluable if you need to revert to a previous version:

1. **Open Local History**: Right-click on your class in the project panel and select "Local History" -> "Show History".
2. **View Changes**: The current version is on the right, and previous versions are listed on the left. Click any previous version to compare it with the current code.
3. **Revert Changes**: Use the arrows to revert specific changes or right-click on a previous version and select "Revert" to restore the entire class to that version.

Local history helps you recover from mistakes or explore how your code has evolved over time.

## Conclusion
- IntelliJ's code comparison and local history features are powerful tools for managing your code. 
- They help you identify differences, revert to previous versions, and ensure your code matches the provided solutions. 
- By leveraging these tools, you can improve your coding efficiency and accuracy. In the next video, we'll introduce coding exercises to further develop your skills. See you in the next video!
