## Configuring IntelliJ IDEA for Java Programming

In this video, we'll configure IntelliJ IDEA to start Java coding. This guide is applicable for Windows, Mac, and Linux users. Firstly, we'll link Oracle's JDK 17 with IntelliJ IDEA. The JDK, or Java Development Kit, contains the necessary tools to write and execute Java programs, including a debugger.

### Setting Up IntelliJ IDEA

Start IntelliJ IDEA and agree to the User Agreement, then select "Don't send" for data sharing. You'll see options for creating a new project, opening an existing project, or getting a project from a Version Control System (VCS). Click "New Project" to create a new one.

IntelliJ will detect the installed JDK. If it doesnâ€™t find it, you can manually add it by navigating to the installation folder (Program Files -> Java -> JDK version on Windows).

### Customizing IntelliJ IDEA

Before starting a new project, customize IntelliJ settings:

1. **Theme**: Go to "Customize" -> "All settings" and choose a theme. "Darcula" is recommended for its gentle-on-the-eyes background, but for video purposes, "IntelliJ Light" is chosen.

2. **Editor Settings**:
    - **Auto-import**: Enable "Add unambiguous imports on the fly" and "Optimize imports on the fly."
    - **Code Folding**: Uncheck "File header," "Imports," "One line methods," "Closures," and "Generic constructor and method parameters" to see all the code.

3. **Appearance**: Ensure "Show line numbers" is checked for better code navigation.

### Creating and Managing Projects

After customization, return to the main screen by clicking "Projects." Here, you'll see a list of all created projects. The "New Project," "Open," and "Get from VCS" buttons might move in future versions, but their functionality remains the same.

With IntelliJ IDEA configured, we're ready to start Java programming. We'll dive into coding in the next video.
